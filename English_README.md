Explained in detail in the ReadMe file (in Hebrew, because the project was for a course of an Israeli university). 
Basically the task was to create a terminal which supports a data structure that was called by the course's books Mergeable Heap
(Even though it is not a heap, the blame for the unfitting name is on the course's staff and a dissonance between the task that the staff has given and the books.),
that is a actually a linked-list that implements the next commands: 
Make-Heap
Insert
Minimum
Extract-Min
Union
All preform the actions that the names suggest (Union merges two of the lists.), 
in efficient time and space complexities, that were calculated by Alon Polsky of the team of students. Also, the terminal supports three modes:
1. The lists will be sorted.
2. The lists won't be sorted.
3. The lists won't be sorted and will not have double appearances of the same key.

After every command's execution the terminal displays a graphical presentation of the current form of the data structures that the terminal uses,
and the terminal can be given a list of commands in the format of a txt file and preform them by order (but also can be given each commands separately of curse.).
